# Rails as an API Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

Please note:

-   Many of the readings will mention the "view" layer. We won't be covering the
    view layer in this program.
-   We'll use our [Rails API Template](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api-template)
    repository as the basis for our rails applications.
    This template excludes the "view" layer.

## Define Model Responsiblities

In your own words, define what the responsibilities of the model layer are in
Rails.

```md
A model receives requests, sends them to the database, and gives back either the
requested information or confirmation of completing the command.
```

## Define Controller Responsiblities

In your own words, define what the responsibilities of the controller layer are
in Rails.

```md
The Controller receives a request, and figures out both what the request should
do as well as what form to send back the data that the request is asking for
after the model returns it.
```

## Define Router Responsiblities

In your own words, define what the router does in Rails.

```md
Routers determine where a particular request should go and send it to the
appropriate controller.
```

## The Request-Response Cycle in Rails

Starting with a client making a GET request to a particular URL, describe how
the parts of Rails interact to produce and send a response.

```md
The server sends the requests to the router, which figures out which controller
handles the request and sends it to that controller.  The controller then contacts
the appropriate model, which finds the resource/does the command to the database.
The model then passes information back to the controller which sends it to the user.
```
